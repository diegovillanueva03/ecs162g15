1. What AI tool did you use?

ChatGPT, Grok

2. How did you use it? What kind of questions did you ask? (include links to your conversation if applicable)

We used ChatGPT and Grok for a few things:

A question about Jinja template best practices:

Creating our mongo database (gave it a sample db json format and had it find UCD bathroom locations and create reviews) it was suprisingly bad:

Creating a script to filter out entries from that DB:

3. How much did it help you? How helpful and accurate was it?

AI was quite useful for this project. Given time constraints creating a DB of bathroom locations and reviews would have been incredibly time consuming. AI made this smooth(ish). I still had to write a python script to derive lng and lat for every location.
